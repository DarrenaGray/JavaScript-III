/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global/Window Binding allows functions to be called from objects on a global or outside scope

* 2. Implicit Binding restricts functions to the context of an object it is chained to

* 3. New Binding uses constructor functions to create new objects to be used 

* 4. Explicit Binding uses "this" to pass arguments to a function within an object
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
